How to prepare

Traditionally, Jollof is cooked over the stovetop; involving with a lot of stirring and sometimes the rice would stick to the pot making the dish quite unappetizing.

In this blog post, I completely eliminated that problem by making it in the oven with just a 5-minute prep time and no constant stirring involved. But if you want to stick to the traditional way, I’ve also included the stovetop method here in this blog post.

It started by RINSING the rice and NOT PARBOILING it. Followed by combining all the ingredients in the baking dish or pan. And lastly, covering it with aluminum foil and popping in the oven. Isn’t that easy enough for you?

Now, if you are not vegan and want to throw in some meat or protein, do so by all means. Simply stir fry shrimp, beef or chicken and medley of vegetables, mix with the rice and serve.
